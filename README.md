#LiipDrupalConnectorModule

##Purpose
Doing quite a number of Drupal projects we found out that for our developers the procedural nature 
of Drupal is always an obstacle. Furthermore as they are used to at least unit test their code, 
they always complaint about the tight coupling and 'invisible' dependencies you have to agree on 
when using the Drupal functions, we had to come up with some kind on an abstraction layer to 
instantiate a dedicated border between our and the Drupal world - the LiipDrupalConnectorModule was
born.
